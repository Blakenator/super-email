# GraphQL Schema Documentation

**All GraphQL schema elements MUST have documentation comments** using triple-quoted strings.

## Required Documentation

- **Types/Input types**: Describe the entity's purpose
- **Queries/Mutations**: Describe what the operation does
- **Fields**: Describe meaning and any constraints
- **Enums**: Describe each value's meaning

## Example

```graphql
"""
A tag that can be applied to emails for organization.
Tags are user-specific and can have custom colors.
"""
type Tag {
  """
  Unique identifier for this tag
  """
  id: String!
  """
  Display name shown in the UI
  """
  name: String!
  """
  Hex color code (e.g., "#ff0000")
  """
  color: String!
}
```
